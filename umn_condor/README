On the UMN "py373_2020" conda environment (ask A. Villano if need assistance) run these jobs for
100-sample batches in order to calculate the true Edelweiss yield variance (a lengthy calculation)
for a wide range of nuisance parameters. 

Run like:

$condor_submit condor-checkDifference-E0-random 

Or this one to submit 100 jobs:

seq 100 |awk '{system("condor_submit condor-checkDifference-E0-random ");}'

The above will give you random selections of points from the input file. If you
don't want random selections you have to use the script "do5k.sh" or a sequence
of shell commands similar to the ones contained in there. 

$./do5k.sh ${EBIN}

The ${EBIN} input specifies the energy bin that we are using: 0,1,2,3.
