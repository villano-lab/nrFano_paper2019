set up this directory to hold matplotlib styles, this will clean up notebooks
this is the first time I'm trying this so eventually it should probably be automatically included
in the repo when it is instantiated. see:

The MPLCONFIGDIR env variable is defined in the .pyenv in the upper directory, that's usually
where I envoke the Jupyter notebooks from. 

Note there were some places I explicitly defined global vars like axis_font, legend_font, and
title_font.  Those are included in the upper directories .pyenv file.
