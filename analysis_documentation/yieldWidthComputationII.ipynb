    "The notebook `yieldWidthComputationI.ipynb` mentioned that the exact ionization yield width computation for the GGA3 detector of the EDELWEISS publication [[EDW2004][EDW2004]] was computationally slow. In fact it takes about 1 min to evaluate the yield width for a single energy. Since our fitting will require several thousand function evaluations we sought a way to compute the yield widths of the electron recoil and nuclear recoil bands much more quickly. The *moment expansion* is the method that we use and it was also employed in the original EDELWEISS publication. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains the moment expansion and compares our version to the slightly less accurate version presented in the original EDELWEISS publication. We need to apply some corrections to the nuclear recoil band version of this expansion in order so that the overall deviation from the exact calculation is kept small. \n",
