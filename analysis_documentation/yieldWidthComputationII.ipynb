    "\n",
    "The notebook `yieldWidthComputationI.ipynb` mentioned that the exact ionization yield width computation for the GGA3 detector of the EDELWEISS publication [[EDW2004][EDW2004]] was computationally slow. In fact it takes about 1 min to evaluate the yield width for a single energy. Since our fitting will require several thousand function evaluations we sought a way to compute the yield widths of the electron recoil and nuclear recoil bands much more quickly. The *moment expansion* is the method that we use and it was also employed in the original EDELWEISS publication. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains the moment expansion and compares our version to the slightly less accurate version presented in the original EDELWEISS publication. We need to apply some corrections to the nuclear recoil band version of this expansion in order so that the overall deviation from the exact calculation is kept small. \n",

Last, the quantity $\\bar{N}$ is simply $E_r\\bar{Q}/\\epsilon_{\\gamma}$ or, in words, the number of electron hole pairs produced by a recoil at a given recoil energy is the average ionization yield evaluated at that energy times the recoil energy and divided by the average electron-equivalent energy to create a single electron-hole pair ($\\epsilon_{\\gamma}$). \n",

    "  * All RVs have only even central moments non-zero, and those are related to the second central moment in a well-defined way. \n",
    "  * Most terms in $E[Q]^2$ have counterpart terms in $E[Q^2]$ which will perfectly cancel after subtraction. Some examples are terms that involve the leading $\\bar{Q}$ of the expansion. \n",
    "  * All terms involving derivatives of $N$ will involve the effective nuclear recoil Fano factor and will vanish if we do not include this (like when evaluating the yield width for electron recoils where the \"Fano\" part of $\\sigma_N$ is implicitly included in the resolutions and very small). *__This fact will be important in the extraction of the effective Fano factor in this work__*. \n",
