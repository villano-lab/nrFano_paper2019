Fit A: Amy's six-parameter fit represents the statistical + systematic (not includeing the binning systematic and the trapping).

Fit B: If we do an analogous fit with only C and m allowed to change but the other values fixed at their best-fit value from the above fit then that gives the purely statistical uncertainty on C and m.

Question: can we use the same likelihood function for Fit A and Fit B?  Yes, if the posterior distributions remain the same when adding a constant to the log-likelihood function.
